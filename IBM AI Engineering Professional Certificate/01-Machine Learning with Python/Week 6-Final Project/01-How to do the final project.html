<p><strong>Notice 1:</strong>&nbsp;In case that you cannot sign-up for the IBM Cloud, when signing up for the IBM Cloud account specify your country/region as United States or Canada. This is a temporary workaround to access the free version of the service.</p>

<p><strong>Notice 2:</strong>&nbsp;If you already have an IBM Cloud account (perhaps you created it for another course) which you created by specifying your country as United States or Canada, and you reached to the usage limit, you have 2 options: 1) Create a new IBM Cloud account with a different email address and country as US or Canada. 2) Use the promo code that gives you 6 months of trial.
