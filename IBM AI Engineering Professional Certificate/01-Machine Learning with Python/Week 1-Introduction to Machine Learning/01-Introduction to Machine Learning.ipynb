    "* **Supervise**, means to observe, and direct the execution of a task, project, or activity. Obviously we aren't going to be supervising a person, instead will be supervising a machine learning model that might be able to produce classification regions like we see here. So, how do we supervise a machine learning model? We do this by teaching the model, that is we load the model with knowledge so that we can have it predict future instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unsupervised learning** is exactly as it sounds. We do not supervise the model, but we let the model work on its own to discover information that may not be visible to the human eye. It means, the unsupervised algorithm trains on the dataset, and draws conclusions on unlabeled data. Generally speaking, unsupervised learning has more difficult algorithms than supervised learning since we know little to no information about the data, or the outcomes that are to be expected. Dimension reduction, density estimation, market basket analysis, and clustering are the most widely used unsupervised machine learning techniques"
